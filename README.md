# Breeze Render Engine

## Introduction

*Breeze Render Engine* is a c++ program that can create and render 3-dimensional scenes. Users have the ability to add, edit, and move objects to create their own pieces of art. *Breeze Render Engine* is my first C++ project, and has taken me around 8 months part time to complete.

<br>

## Supported Systems

- *Windows*

If you would like support for *Linux* or *macOS*, do it yourself. ‚ù§

<br>

### Viewport

When you first start up *Breeze Render Engine*, you'll be introduced to this screen. This is the *Viewport*. 

The *Viewport* is where you can find all the necassary buttons to use the program. The *Viewport* contains multiple panels, with the *3D Scene Viewer* behind it.

<br>

### App Button
In the top left you have the *App Button*. Clicking on this will open a menu with button options.

`Quit`: Quit *Breeze Render Engine*

<br>

### App Bar
On the left side you have the *App Bar*. Here you can toggle selection and add new objects. This are the list of buttons in top-to-bottom order.

`Toggle Selector`: toggle whether objects can be selected or not.

`Add Cube`: add a cube to the scene.

`Add Plane`: add a plane to the scene.

`Add Sphere`: add a sphere to the scene.

`Add OBJ`: add a custom OBJ.

`Add Camera`: add a camera.

`Extra Buttons`: open a menu that allows you add extra objects.

<br>

### Doc Bar
Beneath the *App Bar* in the bottom left is the *Doc Bar*. This provides you access to the documentation as well as the source code.

`Open Documentation`: opens the README file in a web browser.

`Open Source`: opens the source code in a web browser.

<br>

### Top Bar
At the top of the viewport is the *Top Bar*. The *Top Bar* allows you to toggle between wireframe or solid view.

`Wire View`: Select wire view.

`Solid View`: Select solid view.

<br>

### End Bar
The end bar is in the top right of the viewport. It contains buttons that let you report a bug and close the application.

`Report Bug`: Report a bug.

`Quit`: Quit *Breeze Render Engine*

<br>

### The 3D Scene Viewer

The *3D Scene Viewer* is relatively simple. 

`Left Mouse Click`: select objects.

`Left Mouse Drag`: rotate around viewport.

`Scroll Wheel`: zoom.

`Delete Key`: delete selected object.

`0`: toggle between camera view and viewport view.

<br>

### The Properties Panel

The *Properties Panel* is where you control all aspects of the scene. There are 4 kinds of tabs in the properties panel.

`Render Tab`: Contains properties for rendering.

`World Tab`: Contains properties for the viewport

`Object Tab`: Contains properties for the selected object.

`Camera Tab`: Contains properties for the selected camera.

<br>

## Known TODOs

- Rendering transformations aren't correct.
- Rendering not fully implemented.
- Crashes when rendering large images.
- Runs in background after quitting when cancelling render.

<br>

## Tested Systems

- *Windows 10*, *8GB RAM*, *Intel I7-7500U*, *NVIDIA GeForce 940MX*

If you come across any bugs don't report them because they're *features*.
