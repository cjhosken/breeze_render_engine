## Introductions

*Breeze Render Engine* is a c++ program that can create and render 3-dimensional scenes. Users have the ability to add, edit, and move objects to create their own pieces of art.

*Breeze Render Engine* is my first c++ project, and has taken me around 8 months part time to complete.
